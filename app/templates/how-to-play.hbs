<h2>How to play</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</li>
  <li>You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in
    empty squares.</li>

  <li>The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, or
    diagonally) is the winner.</li>

  <li>When all 9 squares are full and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game
    ends in a draw.</li>
</ol>
